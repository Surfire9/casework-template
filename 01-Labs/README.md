# ðŸ§ª Labs

This folder contains **lab notes** from training platforms, courses, or exercises.  
Each lab gets its own subfolder, which includes notes and (optional) screenshots.

---

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use

1. Create a new subfolder for each lab using this format:  
   lab-<topic>-YYYY-MM-DD/

   Example:  
   lab-active-recon-2025-09-25/

2. Inside the lab folder, include at least:
   - notes.md â†’ your lab notes, created from templates/lab-notes-template.md
   - screenshots/ (optional) â†’ redacted screenshots if they add value

   Example structure:
   01-Labs/
   â””â”€â”€ lab-active-recon-2025-09-25/
       â”œâ”€â”€ notes.md
       â””â”€â”€ screenshots/
           â”œâ”€â”€ nmap-scan.png
           â””â”€â”€ ad-enum.png

3. Keep notes concise:
   - Objective (what the lab is about)  
   - Key commands / steps (reusable later)  
   - Takeaways (what you learned or want to revisit)  

4. Sanitize all files before committing:
   - Replace real IPs/hostnames with <placeholders>  
   - Run tools/sanitize.sh
