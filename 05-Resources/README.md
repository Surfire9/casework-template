# ðŸ“š Resources

This folder contains **references, cheatsheets, and supporting materials** that help with labs, incidents, and projects.  
Each resource should be its own file or subfolder for clarity.

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use

1. Use the templates/resource-template.md as a starting point.  
2. Name files descriptively:  
   resource-<topic>.md  
   Example: resource-git-cheatsheet.md  

3. Group related resources into subfolders if needed:
   - certifications/ â†’ notes for Security+, CySA+, etc.  
   - checklists/ â†’ sanitization, incident response, etc.  
   - references/ â†’ curated links, reading lists  

   Example structure:
   05-Resources/
   â”œâ”€â”€ resource-git-cheatsheet.md
   â”œâ”€â”€ resource-sanitization-checklist.md
   â””â”€â”€ certifications/
       â””â”€â”€ resource-security-plus.md

4. Keep resources concise and actionable â€” they should be quick reference points, not full textbooks.
