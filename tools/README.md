## 🚀 How to Use

1. Place all helper scripts (e.g., sanitization, redaction, log cleaners) in this folder. 
2. Make scripts executable:
   chmod +x tools/<scriptname>.sh
3. Run them manually or configure them as pre-commit hooks.

## 🔮 Future Ideas

- redact.sh → Automatically blur/redact sensitive strings in Markdown. 
- pcap-scrubber.py → Remove personal data from packet captures. 
- report-checker.sh → Verify incident/playbook files follow naming conventions.

Keeping these tools here ensures every repo created from this template has a **built-in safety net** for sanitization and professional consistency.
